# 🧐Next.js API Routes: Fetching and Displaying Data

This project demonstrates various aspects of data fetching using API routes in Next.js. It guides you from basic to advanced concepts, providing a solid foundation for working with APIs in your Next.js applications.

## 👷‍♀️Project Structure

* **`app/Users`:** This page displays a list of usernames retrieved from the JSONPlaceholder API. Clicking on a username leads to a user detail page.
* **`app/Users/[id].js`:** This dynamic page renders posts created by a specific user, fetched from a separate API endpoint.
* **`app/DogsApi`:** This page displays a random dog image retrieved from the Dog API on every page reload.
* **`app/api/*/route.js`:** This file houses the API routes responsible for fetching data from external APIs.

## 👩‍💻Learning Objectives

* **Fetching Data with API Routes:** Learn how to create API routes in Next.js to fetch data from external sources.
* **Multi-Endpoint Data Flow:** Understand how to chain data fetching from multiple API endpoints for complex data interactions.
* **Dynamic Routing:** Explore dynamic routing in Next.js to render user-specific content based on URL parameters.
* **Image Fetching:** Implement fetching and displaying images in Next.js applications.

## 😎Advantages of Next.js API Routes over React with RTK Query

While both approaches facilitate API interactions in React applications, Next.js API Routes offer several advantages:

* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** API routes enable SSR, improving initial page load performance and SEO.
* **Automatic Data Fetching:** API routes can pre-fetch data during build time or on the server at request time, reducing client-side load.
* **Code Organization:** API routes keep data fetching logic separate from React components, promoting cleaner code structure.

## 🆕Getting Started
